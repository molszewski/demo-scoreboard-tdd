You are working on a sports data company, and we would like you to develop a new Live Football World Cup Score Board that shows matches and scores.  

The board supports the following operations: 

### Start a game

When a game starts, it should capture (being initial score 0 – 0): 
- Home team 
- Away team 

### Finish game

It will remove a match from the scoreboard. 

### Update score

Receiving the home team score and away team score updates a game score. 

### Get a summary of games by total score

Those games with the same total score will be returned ordered by the most recently added to our system.  

As an example, being the current data in the system: 

    Mexico - Canada: 0 - 5  
    Spain - Brazil: 10 – 2 
    Germany - France: 2 – 2 
    Uruguay - Italy: 6 – 6 
    Argentina - Australia: 3 - 1  

The summary would provide with the following information:  

    Uruguay 6 - Italy 6 
    Spain 10 - Brazil 2 
    Mexico 0 - Canada 5 
    Argentina 3 - Australia 1 
    Germany 2 - France 2
